This program allows users to create vector images as well as raster images such as photographs. \n \n In order to get started we will take some time out to explain exactly what these terms mean so let's begin! \n \n \n \n Vector Images are created when lines are drawn between points instead of pixels being placed side-by-side. These types of images allow designers to scale their work without losing quality because they don't rely upon pixel density but rather line thickness.  \n \n Raster Images are created when dots are arranged into squares called \"pixels\". When viewed closely enough all computer screens display only individual pixels; therefore if you zoomed right in close enough you'd see each dot individually. Because of this fact, any image displayed on screen would appear jagged no matter how high its resolution was set. However, once printed onto paper there wouldn't really be much difference whether it's a low-resolution photo or a high-quality digital print since both would look smooth due to the large number of pixels used per square inch. \n \n Now that we've explained those two different ways of displaying images lets move on...","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":28}

Well here\u2019s how you could make sure everyone stays warm enough even without having access to air-conditioners.    Room Heaters  A good way would be by installing some portable heaters like oil filled radiators (which don\u2019t consume too many electricity) into every single cubicle\/work station within...   If this method seems expensive,...    Another option might be getting hold of a small space heater....    You may also try out infrared heaters but these tend to dry out the skin very quickly..     Make sure not to use anything electrical near flammable materials!    Furniture  Try arranging everything neatly together instead of leaving them scattered across different corners of the room.  This will ensure maximum coverage against the cold.  Also place carpets over hardwood floors wherever possible.  Remember - carpeted areas retain heat better than bare wood surfaces do!  Lighting  Darker colors absorb less light compared to lighter ones.  So go ahead and paint those walls black \u2013 it\u2019s actually quite trendy nowadays anyway!!  And remember to turn off unnecessary lights when you\u2019re done working.  It\u2019ll save energy and money both!!!

This can only happen when you've successfully caught the ball being thrown at you by another member of the opposite team.     There are many ways to play this game but here we present our version which involves four teams playing against each other simultaneously using a regulation sized basketball court divided into three equal sections called end zones.   Each team consists of seven players including a captain whose job is to direct his\/her team mates throughout the match.   All matches consist of five periods lasting ten minutes per period except for the final where there'll just be three periods instead.   You may choose whichever number of players you'd like to include within these limits however it's recommended that you use between six and eight players per team so long as everyone plays equally well.

This article provides information regarding how to treat a Bartholin cyst at home before seeking medical attention; however, it's important to know what tests need to take place so proper care can begin immediately afterwards:   Your physician should perform a physical exam including pelvic exams to check for lumps around the vulva and labia majora.    A laboratory test might also be performed to rule out other conditions like infections or tumors.     Ultrasound imaging could be used to confirm whether you're dealing with a Bartholin cyst rather than another type of mass.","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":188}

{"text":"Cobra yoga poses can be done anywhere at any time.  You don't need special equipment; all you'll need is some open space where you're not likely to get knocked over while practicing this advanced posture.   If you'd like to practice outside of class but aren't quite ready yet, try performing cobra indoors first before moving outdoors (or vice versa). The most common place people perform cobra is during their warm-ups prior to beginning an actual workout routine.    This will help prepare them physically and mentally for what lies ahead.  It also helps improve flexibility throughout... Lie flat on your stomach facing upwards towards the ceiling.... Draw your shoulder blades gently apart,... Bend your neck backward until it's almost touching the floor. ...  Exhale deeply through pursed lips.  Inhale again when you've reached peak height.  Repeat 3-5 times per set.  Don't forget about breathing!   Do 2-3 sets total.  Rest between sets 1-2 minutes.  Practice regularly!  Be patient.  Always listen to your body's signals. .    To do this:  Stand straight with your arms raised above your head.  Turn one foot 45 degrees outward.  Rotate your torso 90 degrees counterclockwise around your hip joint.  Bring your arm opposite your turned leg behind your back.  Extend your free hand upward along side your bent knee.  Continue rotating your torso clockwise 180 degrees.  Return to center.  Repeat 10-12 times per set.  Do 2 sets total.  Rest 1 minute between sets.  Try these exercises once every 3-4 days after warming up.  They'll strengthen your core which makes cobra easier to hold longer without straining too much.  These movements should feel natural and easy--don't force anything.  Focus only on feeling good rather than trying to achieve perfection immediately.  For example,  if you find it difficult to keep your elbows tucked under your ribs, simply bring them closer instead of forcing them further inward.  As long as they're still pointing downwards, they won't interfere with the movement itself.  In fact, they'll actually make it look better because it'll give you something else to focus on besides just holding the pose correctly.  It's okay to cheat here since we're talking about improving our technique anyway.  Just remember to always return to correct positioning whenever possible.","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":206}

You may choose to hire professional movers because you don't feel confident handling such a big project alone,    but there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t handle much of the heavy lifting yourself.    In fact, it\u2019s often cheaper than paying someone else to do it!    Moving companies charge based upon volume rather than weight, which means that they\u2019ll bill more money simply because something takes up space.    For example, a dresser that\u2019s only half-full might cost twice as much to ship compared to another identical dresser that's completely full.    To save money when shipping bulky items, consider renting a storage unit until after you've moved.    Then fill it with books, clothing, toys etc. instead of sending those items along with your household goods.    Another option would be to ask friends or relatives living nearby to hold onto certain items while you move.    When choosing a mover, check online reviews thoroughly.    Ask around among people whose recent moves were handled by various local firms.    Check references too.    Never pay anything upfront unless you know exactly whom you\u2019re dealing with.    Keep in mind that reputable movers won\u2019t require payment until they've completed the job.    There are numerous websites dedicated solely to helping consumers locate qualified movers; here are two examples:  http:\/\/www.movingreviews.com\/find-a-moving-company\/   https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com Once you\u2019ve found a few potential candidates,...","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":308}

You should also consider getting professional cleaning done on your feather pillows every three years so that they're kept fresh and hygienic.

For example, you could use a soft-bristled toothbrush to scrub away stains around seams. Make sure there is no loose fabric sticking up at... Place 2 pillows inside the washing machine along with 1\u20442\u00a0\u00a0c (120\u00a0ml) (2\u20443\u00a0\u00a0tsp) liquid dish soap. The amount of soap you'll need depends on how dirty your pillows are; start small and add more later if necessary. Avoid using regular dishwashing soap because its high suds may cause the feathers to clump together when wet. A mild detergent like Woolite Laundry Stain Remover works best since it won't strip color off of the pillows' covers. To avoid damaging the feathers, set your washing machine's temperature setting to \"Delicate\" instead of \"Hot\". Then select \"Drain & Spin Cycle Only\" rather than \"Washing\".

To start shuffling, place both hands over top of the entire pack of cards, then rub them back-and-forth against each other while moving forward across the table.  Keep doing this motion until you've moved past halfway into the pack; once you've reached the middle portion of the pack, switch directions again - now move backward instead of forwards.  Then repeat this process several times until every single card feels smooth when touched.  Once finished, lay the whole pack flat side-down onto the tabletop and mix everything up using only your fingers.

It has been praised for its graphics, soundtracks (both original music composed specifically for SSBM), characters' designs, story mode, online play modes, multiplayer options, and more.   The gameplay itself was revolutionary when released on GameCube back in 2002 -  players could now control their character using analog sticks instead of directional buttons only.    This made movement much smoother than ever seen before; however, this new feature came along with some problems too.     In order to make up for these issues, Nintendo added several features such as:    *The ability to hold down special moves like forward smash until they were fully charged.        *A \"special meter\" which would fill overtime while holding certain attacks.        *New ways to recover health after taking damage including items and healing stages.        *More advanced controls allowing for better precision movements.      These additions helped improve upon the already great mechanics found within the first installment of the series.

Here are just ten ways to get started using this powerful tool. \n \n 1.) Gather Real World Data \n \n \n \n Have your students gather information about something happening right now - whether it's news related like elections, sports games, weather forecasts etc.. Or perhaps they're studying geography? They could look at earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes erupting, traffic jams, accidents, protests, riots, natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, wildfires, droughts, forest fires, snowstorms, ice storms, thunderstorms, heat waves, cold spells, wind gusts, hail storms, mudslides, land slides, avalanches, volcanic eruptions, solar flares, space launches, moon phases, sunsets, sunrises, eclipses, auroras borealis, meteor showers, lunar cycles, comets passing through Earth's orbit, meteoroids striking the atmosphere, asteroids approaching our planet's surface, satellites being launched into space, spacecraft flying past us, rocket blasts off, rockets returning back down to earth, astronauts walking on the Moon, Mars rovers exploring the Red Planet, Jupiter moons, Saturn rings, Pluto dwarf planets, Neptune blue oceanic clouds, Uranus red coloring, Venus bright lightening, Mercury dark nights, Milky Way galaxy clusters, galaxies moving away from each other, black holes swallowing everything in sight, gravitational lensing effects, quasars emitting huge amounts of energy, gamma ray bursts exploding across the sky, pulsar radio signals coming from distant stars, supernovae explosions, star formation, galactic winds blowing dust particles towards nearby stars, interstellar medium consisting mostly of hydrogen gas, nebulae glowing brighter than most stars, infrared radiation emitted by hot plasma surrounding young stellar objects, cosmic rays streaming outward from supermassive black holes located deep within active galactic nuclei, or maybe they're looking at animals migrating seasonally? \n \n Whatever you're teaching, have your students collect real-time data via Twitter feeds. You may want to assign specific hashtags and\/or keywords to track during certain times throughout the day\/night\/morning\/afternoon depending upon what's going on.

Boots: They provide protection against cold water temperatures and sharp objects like rocks and branches.       Ropes: These range widely based on preference and budget.

Change Passwords Regularly  Changing your passwords regularly helps keep hackers off your system.

This guide aims to give you information as well as practical tips so that you get back what's rightfully yours.   The first step towards getting your stuff back is to consider how much longer you'd want this person around if they didn't own anything from before the relationship started.    You need to think carefully whether it's worth it to keep trying to work together amicably - even though you've broken up - just because there might be something here that's important enough to you both to save.     It would also be helpful to know where all your possessions currently lie;  do you have them stored somewhere else?   Are they being held by friends?  Do you have duplicates elsewhere?\nOnce you've decided exactly what you want...and don't want,...you'll probably find yourself wondering why he hasn't handed everything back already....or maybe he's done but now wants more!  It's very common for people to take items belonging to each other during relationships without thinking twice about it;  sometimes these items are gifts received while others are simply 'borrowed'.  But once the relationship ends many questions arise regarding ownership of such items.  In order to avoid future arguments, it's best to establish clearly beforehand whose belongings are whose.  Here are some suggestions:-    Make sure you always write down serial numbers wherever possible.  Take photographs of every item you buy jointly throughout the course of the relationship.  Keep receipts whenever buying new items together.  Write lists of joint purchases made online.  Don't leave personal effects lying around unattended!","label":1,"model":"bloomz","source":"wikihow","id":460}

You may also wish to read How to Find Easter Using Microsoft Excel.     Step 1: Write down the dates of Easter from 1900 through 2050. These are available online at: http:\/\/www.usacatholicschoolbooks.com\/easter\/calendar-of-easter-dates-1900-2050.html     Step 2: Determine the last digit of the year code. Add up the digits of the year until they equal four. Then multiply them times ten. Subtract these figures from the total number of days since Jan 1st, 1900. The remaining number should be divisible by 7. (For example, 2020 would give you:  2020 - 19 x 10 - 9 = 21 - 190 - 90 = 11 - 210 = -1)  Note that there were no leap years between 1901 and 1930; therefore, their codes remain unchanged compared to those used before 1950.        Step 3: Figure out the day code based upon the month and year. Multiply the month's code by its corresponding factor below.
